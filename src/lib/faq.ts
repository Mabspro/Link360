  {
    q: "How does Link360 shipping work?",
    a: "You pledge how much space (volume) you need and get an estimated cost. When enough interest is collected, we announce the container and confirm with you. Payment is only due after confirmation.",
  },
  {
    q: "What are the standard box sizes?",
    a: "S (18×18×18 in), M (24×24×24 in), L (24×24×48 in), TV (18×18×48 in). You can also enter custom dimensions or use a rough estimate (small/medium/large).",
  },
  {
    q: "How is cost calculated?",
    a: "Shipping cost is based on volume: rate per cubic inch × your volume. Pickup fee: $25 in-city, or $25 + $15 per box for out-of-city. See the Pricing page for examples.",
  },
  {
    q: "When do I pay?",
    a: "This is interest-only. No payment at pledge time. We contact you when the container is confirmed and then collect payment.",
  },
  {
    q: "What cannot be shipped?",
    a: `Prohibited: ${PROHIBITED_ITEMS}`,
  },
  {
    q: "Where do containers go?",
    a: "NorCal → Lusaka or Ndola, Zambia. Each pool is for one destination and one container type (20ft or 40ft).",
  },
  {
    q: "Why do you need documents before the container arrives?",
    a: "Zambia requires pre-clearance before goods arrive. Submitting a packing list, invoice, and receiver details in advance helps avoid delays at the border. Customs clearance (including ASYCUDA) is smoother when documents are ready.",
  },
  {
    q: "Do you support solar or green logistics?",
    a: "We’re aware of Zambia’s focus on energy access and green growth. Our current pools are general cargo; we’re keeping an eye on demand for dedicated energy-equipment lanes and will adapt as the corridor evolves.",
